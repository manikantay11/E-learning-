This paper proposes an online eLearning platform for web development education targeting beginner and intermediate learners. The platform will offer interactive courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related technologies to build modern websites and web applications.
Self-paced lessons include video tutorials, coding exercises with automatic validation, quizzes and sample projects to provide hands-on learning. Courses will teach web fundamentals like page structure, styling, responsive design, DOM manipulation and front-end frameworks like React and Angular.
Additional topics may cover backend web technologies as the platform expands. The eLearning environment enables learners to develop essential web developer skills at their own pace. Built-in forums facilitate peer collaboration and instructor guidance. Progress tracking and automatic grading of assignments provide insight into mastery of concepts.
The platform delivers flexible, engaging education of in-demand skills for those pursuing careers in web development or supplementary self-study. We aim to make quality web development education accessible for diverse learners across a spectrum of experience levels. Further development aims to incorporate adaptive learning, gamification and career guidance resources.
